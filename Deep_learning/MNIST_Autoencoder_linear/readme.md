### The neural network used in this is a linear layer 
# Autoencoder that encodes and decodes the image.
An autoencoder is a type of neural network that finds the function mapping the features *x* to itself. This objective is known as reconstruction, and an autoencoder accomplishes this through the following process: 

1. An encoder learns the data representation in lower-dimension space, i.e. extracting the most salient features of the data, and 
2. A decoder learns to reconstruct the original data based on the learned representation by the encoder.
